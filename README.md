# OpenUI5 and Java EE from nothing to a working WebApp on an Amazon EC2 box

In this session we will create a new Java EE 7 maven project with an JPA bean than exposing this bean with Olingo as an JAX-RS OData service, consuming it with an OpenUI5 client and in the end deploying it on a new amazon ec2 box. The main focus is on live coding and solving all challenges that arise during the session. Further it should show how to publish and app from idea to final operations and give examples which technologies are available for the different layers: Database, Persistence, Business Logic and Frontend.
